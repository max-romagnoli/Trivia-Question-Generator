## Whole Team

### #1

**Issue**: The team faced a significant decision regarding the technology stack, ultimately choosing React for the 
frontend and Flask for the backend.

**Discussion**: This decision involved considerations of individual team members' expertise, project requirements, and 
the need for a seamless frontend-backend integration.

### #2

**Issue**: Making the application accessible by deploying it on Heroku.

**Discussion**: We chose Heroku for easy deployment and decided to enable the Autoidle feature, which automatically 
puts the application to sleep during inactivity and activates the program on-demand. This was done to facilitate access 
to the application without the need of building it locally.

## Backend Team

### #3

**Issue**: Ensuring smooth communication between the backend and frontend teams became a focal point.

**Discussion**: We engaged in discussions on API design, data formats, and endpoints to facilitate effective 
collaboration, avoiding potential bottlenecks during implementation.

### #4

**Issue**: Designing the highscore endpoint required decisions on data structure, sorting, and the number of entries 
to display.

**Discussion**: We collaborated to determine the format of the highscore endpoint's response, considering factors such 
as ordering, limiting the number of entries, and handling ties in scores.

### #5

**Issue**: Establishing a database schema for storing user information and highscores.

**Discussion**: We all sat down to define the structure of the database, discussing the need for unique identifiers, 
data types, and the most efficient way to query and update highscore data.


## Frontend Team

### #6

**Issue**: Choosing a cohesive color palette and designing a consistent UI/UX for the Trivia game app.

**Discussion**: The frontend team deliberated on color choices, ensuring accessibility and a visually appealing interface. 
Discussions also revolved around maintaining a consistent design language across various components to enhance user 
experience.

### #7

**Issue**: Determining the user interaction flow and interface elements for displaying scores, question values, and 
other relevant information during the game.

**Discussion**: The team engaged in discussions to map out the user journey, deciding where and how to display critical 
information such as scores and question values. Considerations included the placement of UI elements, ensuring they do 
not interfere with the gaming experience, and providing clear feedback to the user.
